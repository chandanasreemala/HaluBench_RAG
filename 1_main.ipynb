The interchange will be on the north side of the A8, just on the Edinburgh side of gogar roundabout.\\nUnfortunately Network Rail is not taking cycling seriously. They are doing the easy bits, like connecting the new station to the north side of the A8 and providing bike parking. However, a new underpass of the A8, linking the Gyle to the new station will be designed for walkers only, although you will be allowed to push a bike.\\nEven if you are short of time, it is quick and easy to make a very short objection, and this really helps!\\nObjections must reach Edinburgh City Council by this Friday 13 November. To make a short submission, use the ‘submit comments’ button at the above link to the planning application. We suggest that you categorise your comment as an ‘objection’ – or you have the alternative of making a ‘general observation.’ Make sure to quote the number of the planning application, 09/02589.\\nPlease also copy your objection to your local councillors and ask them to support you at the Planning Committee. Find them at.\\nIf you are after 13 November it’s too late for a formal objection, but still very worthwhile asking your councillors to support you on this at the Planning Committee.\\nThe planning application itself admits that the current position for cyclists wishing to access the area of the site is appalling. It says [Transport Assessment, 3.7] “routes for crossing the A8 necessitate large diversions, via the RBS overbridge approximately 800m to the west of the roundabout, or via signal controlled pedestrian crossings at the Turnhouse Road/A902 Maybury Road/A8 Glasgow Road junction approximately 600m to the east.”\\nThe planning application’s reason for not allowing cycle use [Transport Assessment, 6.4] is so outdated in its understanding that it could be almost amusing if this wasn’t so serious, “The subway will be gated at its southern end to form an entrance to the interchange, which will be more attractive to users. As a result, pedestrian users of the subway may not expect cyclists on their cycles to be using the subway. Signage will be installed to instruct cyclists to dismount within the subway, and so maximise the quality of the subway experience for the majority of users.”\\nNetwork Rail should be following the Council’s Standards for Sustainable Buildings which state that development proposals should “offer genuine and practical alternatives to car use by prioritising €˜desire€™ lines for pedestrians and cyclists.” We can hardly call this a genuine and practical prioritising of cyclist desire lines!!\\nThere are some other important points to be made – please considering including these in your objection …\\na. The proposal is an underpass which is basically station-access only, and so will be closed off when the station is not open. The underpass should instead be part of Edinburgh’s path network, and open 24/7.\\nb. The path from the underpass should continue through the station site so as to link on to other expected future developments in the area, allowing continuous cycle access between them and the Gyle. At present only a 2m wide footpath is proposed beyond the station to a future ‘International Business Gateway’ development.\\nNote – If you decide to look at the plans online, click ‘associated documents’ at the link to the planning application. You’ll find masses of documents. Relevant ones include the TRANSPORT ASSESSMENT (it is in 2 files) and ‘PROPOSED SITE PLAN SHOWING INGRESS ROUTES.’\\nMisleading information – Network Rail in several places refers to the underpass as “pedestrian/cycle access” – but only by carefully reading the transport assessment do you discover that it is actually pedestrian access only, although you are permitted to push things such as bikes. Similarly, a Spokes member who commented at an earlier stage was told by Network Rail, “For foot and cycle passengers on the south side of the A8 further access to the east side of the station is provided via a subway below the A8. This subway will also enable rail passengers to access the Gyle Shopping Centre.” Very, very cheeky – implying, though not actually stating, that proper cycle access will be provided. They must not be allowed to get away with this!!\\nFinally, the project is being funded by the Scottish government via Transport Scotland. When we comment on the government’s low spending on cycling we are constantly told that as well as the well-known money to councils the government also spends on cycling via Transport Scotland’s big projects – if so, let’s see them take cycling seriously here! Indeed, there’s a good argument for also writing to your MSPs, asking them why Transport Scotland is being allowed to fund schemes which don’t take cycling seriously.\\n.'),\n",

Farah Naqvi writes.india Updated: Sep 19, 2011 21:51 IST.\\nIt’s inevitable that justice for the weak will be a political hard sell. And laws around the world seeking to secure justice and equality for the weak have been forged through fires of hot contestation. The first Civil Rights Act of 1957 in the US was greeted by howls of protest from White chauvinists.\\nEven ‘liberal’ John F Kennedy chose political realism over principle and voted against it in Congress for he knew it had little popular support at the time. JFK became a ‘civil rights champion’ later; some say only when he sensed greater need for the Black vote.\\nCloser home, the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, was preceded by a robust Dalit rights movement, and high profile cases of Dalit atrocities set the stage for its passage.\\nBut the backlash soon followed and attempts continue till today to stymie its implementation. The Draft Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence Bill, 2011, (PCTV) faces similar challenges.\\nThese laws are different from the spate of legislative and policy measures in recent years ensuring basic entitlements. Take the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Education (RTE) — one promised employment to the rural poor, the other elementary education.\\nThese are unexceptionable wares to peddle in the political marketplace of populist ideas, lending themselves easily to sound byte debates in TV studios, apparently the new testing ground for ‘popular will’.\\nThe arguments that NREGA and RTE faced weren’t social or political, but economic (with neo-liberals asking: ‘Will there be too much burden on the exchequer?’ Or ‘Why do the poor deserve such generous hand-outs?’).\\nBut special protection legislations, within a civil rights framework, seeking to install systems of justice for the weak are different. They demand that we as a nation acknowledge inequality and discrimination as a fact of our society, polity and criminal justice system. They demand the naming of particular classes of citizens as weak and others as strong.\\nThey demand from our political class a will to embrace principles of equal, secular citizenship over the politics of populism.\\nThe PCTV bill is anti-secular, it should be burnt, it should be put in a trashcan — these are are some of the unnecessarily strident remarks we’ve heard in recent TV debates.\\nCuriously, the government’s discredited Communal Violence Bill of 2005 didn’t elicit such shrill abandonment of civilised discourse because the 2005 bill didn’t challenge the biased use of State power that allows communal violence to spread.\\nIn fact, it augmented and further concentrated powers in the hands of the State (Modi would have embraced such a bill).\\nThe 2011 PCTV Bill, by comparison, attracts vicious protest partly because it does threaten the communal violence machinery, by making the State accountable for discriminatory use of its powers.\\nEvidence of this does not need to be excavated from the recesses of distant history — because State bias in cases of identity-based attacks is not a thing of the past, as critics claim. Look at the fate of Dalits and Muslims in recent weeks and months — in Madurai (September 2011), Moradabad (August 2011) or Bharatpur (September 2011); look at Tamils in Karnataka (March 2008) or Biharis in Mumbai (October 2008). They are why we need this bill.\\nThere may be much in the draft PCTV Bill, 2011 that its critics can improve, but its core (robust State accountability) represents the hope of securing equal protection of laws for all citizens; of giving meaning to the idea of sadbhavna.\\nPolitical momentum follows from acts of political courage and for true sadbhavna we need that courage from our political class.\\n(Farah Naqvi is a member of the National Advisory Council.

In an effort to keep students up on the curriculum, plans involving take-home lessons were outlined.\\n\"The elementary school students would have their packets to fill out, and junior and high school students will be able to use their Chromebooks to complete their online assignments,\" Wigton said. \"For students that don\\'t have internet available at home, there are still hotspots available through our T-Mobile grant.\"\\nHe said all events for all grades, kindergarten through 12, involving parents and the public have been cancelled until after the district\\'s spring break. For any other additional changes, Wigton said they\\'d be announced by building administrators.\\n\"We don\\'t want to confuse an already confusing situation. We\\'re going to try to postpone what events we can and see what we need to implement to create social distance,\" he said. \"We\\'ve also reminded students of proper handwashing procedures, and the schools have plenty of disinfectant and soap.\"\\n\"These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary measures.

Right now, we\\'re focused on maintaining the health of those incarcerated and our staff,\" he said.\\nFather Craig Eilerman, of St. Mary\\'s of the Assumption in Lancaster, said events involving people outside the parish have been cancelled.\\n\"We will continue to have masses, unless we are told otherwise or if the pandemic spreads here. However, we are cancelling some of our other events, just to help minimize the risk of spreading any illness,\" he said. \"And during our masses, we will only be distributing the consecrated bread, there will be no wine.\"\\n\"These actions are preventative in nature, the idea is to cut down on large gatherings as much as we can. We are a people of hope, we will get through this.\"\\nRev. Brian Jones, the senior pastor of the Lancaster First United Methodist Church, issued the following statement.\\n\"We are taking the outbreak of the Coronavirus seriously. We are taking extra measures to disinfect the \"touchpoints\\' of the church (door handles pews door knobs etc.) throughout the week to insure we keep the church as clean and virus free as possible. Your health, and the health of your family are a priority for us in our overall ministry. We are not planning to cancel worship.

I had created arranged in order to meet my lady in a nearby recreation space in order that my own 3 boys could blow-off a number of water prior to planning property for supper.\\nIt had been there in a vehicle recreation area that we noticed a person trying to clay-bar their own automobile. Certain things struck us as unusual. To start with while i have already been based in Exercise the past 20 years We have seldom witnessed someone work with their own automobile along with the following was a man wanting to clay bar! That was fantastic.\\nSecondly this individual ended up being trying really without success for you to clay bar his / her auto. I couldn’t support myself personally, I needed to bring in personally and offer him several ideas.\\nPupil this individual ended up being a us surviving in Europe anf the husband has been organizing the rear spoiler in order that he or she might aluminum foil that. He’d learnt from the Internet in which before using foil that the paint surface has to be decontaminated with a clay-bar. Appropriate! Nevertheless exactly what the forum failed to tell him ended up being just what is a Clay-Bar and ways to use it correctly?\\nSo what is a new Clay Bar?\\nInside the Eighties, a few extremely intelligent people in The japanese invented the particular Clay-Bar. Car makers had been trying to find a approach to speedily remove overspray coming from recently coloured autos and never have to vacation resort moist sanding. Nowadays it is unimaginable to get a expert detailer to never make use of a clay-bar.\\nDecontaminating the color.\\nWhenever a vehicle can be powered or even sitting outside the house, it will pick-up a few quite unpleasant grime debris like very hot braking system airborne debris, iron debris coming from train songs, street tar residue even unclean rain could imprinted themselves in to the coloring. Inside the describing globe we all call this ‘contamination’ and eliminate substances is certainly a important action i will attempt to describe without sending that you rest.\\nSoil contaminants upload themselves deeply in to the obvious coating. Washing the car won’t remove these types of partials. It is essential to take away the toxins before sharpening as if you not can become with additional hairline chafes.\\nI want to make clear. Make a very small small materials regarding fine sand trapped to the surface of the paint. If you don’t take away that wheat involving mud and you review that using a sprucing device that is rotating in 1’500 revs per minuet. In which resolution is certain to get captured inside the mat and also provide simple facts in wonderful round moves. The same as sand paper. That hurts!\\nJust how Clay Bar aids\\nClay bar can be a desperate stop regarding pliable plastic just like content which has a similar uniformity to learn money. Consider it as any ‘dirt magnet’. Since the clay is indeed ‘sticky’, the dirt does not have any chance of clinging on the fresh paint surface area; the idea re-embeds alone on top of the clay bar. Following numerous goes by, the particular clay bar will become packed with substances, which you can observe within the image and for that reason you have to on a regular basis collapsed the particular clay to press the determination to the core of the clay.\\nWhat’s crucial when using clay as well as what my good friend in a vehicle car park was without is ‘Lubrication’. Lubes might be clean water or even even better any detailers bottle of spray that you simply spray directly on top of the autos area. Unless you work with a squirt the actual clay will undoubtedly stick to the area, end up being difficult to shift making a terrible mess with pieces of clay adhering your car or truck rather than raising from the dirt. Even worse it could possibly also scratch your car or truck.\\nDone correctly, it is possible to notice the paint turning into cleaner. That will start as being a itches sound then after a few goes gets silent as well as less noisy. I’m talking about the actual clay undertaking it can be operate raising off of all of the nasty’s.\\nOnce you’ve done your coloring has become de-contaminated.\\nAlso an important tip! Should you unintentionally decline your own clay, throw it away. There isn’t any chance of keeping becoming soon as it has contacted the floor; it’s picked out more dirt this ever could from the vehicle. In the event you begin to use that once more, it’s going to scratch the coloring.'),\n",

Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.\\nThe problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.\\nOn the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”\\nWhat to Do\\n- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.\\n- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.\\n- Don’t be scared to set limits.\\n- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.\\n- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.\\n- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.\\n- Be a role model for your teenager.\\n- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.\\n- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.\\n- Never use physical or mental torture.\\n- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.\\n- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!\\nIn the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..'),\n",

All I have to do is chop some raw ingredients and it makes me look like a great cook. I’m not, but it allows me the indulgent self-delusion and that’s not to be sniffed at.\\nThere are some surreal side effects though –\\n1. Following breakfast, you do all the preparation for your tea. This can leave you wondering when exactly in the day it is.\\n2. By the time its ready to eat you’ve kinda forgotten you had anything to do with it, because you go into the kitchen “to make tea” and all you have to do is dish it up. This makes you feel like someone else made it (always a good thing). It can also make you feel like you get your food from meals on wheels (not always a good thing).\\nMy simple and incredibly lazy recipe for slow cooking happiness –\\n1. Chop up a few potatoes, as many as you’d have if you were having baked potatoes. Don’t worry about peeling them, its going to be cooking for ages and you’ll not even notice them. Chuck them in the slow cooker.\\n2. Very lazy bit – add some frozen vegetables, whatever you fancy. Just throw them in the pot frozen, they’ll be fine. The slow cooker will be going long enough to cook them properly.\\n3. Chop an onion, don’t throw that in yet.\\n4. Chop up some meat to your preference. Steak and kidney is good. So is turkey. I’m partial to lambs hearts myself.\\n5. Grab a pan, put some Extra Virgin Olive Oil in and put it on the heat. Make sure its extra virgin oil, not because it’ll make any difference to the end product, but because it’ll make you feel more like a proper cook. If you really want to add to the ambience, make sure its in a poncy bottle too.\\n6. Throw the meat into the hot oil, knock it about a bit until it starts to brown, then throw the chopped onion in too. Make sure you turn on the extractor fan when you’re doing this, so that people passing can think you’re a proper cook because of the nice smells coming out of your kitchen. (Note, this will only work if your neighbours and anyone passing can’t cook. Anyone who can cook will know that the only reason you’ll be cooking anything savoury that early in the morning is because you’re slow cooking and therefore can’t cook at all).\\n7. Once the meat has browned, put the meat and onions into the slow cooker. Add in about 350ml of water, a stock cube and salt and pepper, give it a stir and set it going.\\n8. If you happen to be around a couple of hours before it finishes cooking, throw in a handful of paxo for some extra flavour and some thickening.\\nErm, that’s it. Not exactly rocket science eh?'),\n",

My friend and I had raised questions with each other about the motivation behind prayer and what prayer looks like. We talked about the in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit. Transformation vs. performance and where the former comes from, and how. Rohr’s contributions to the discussion concerned the 9 stages of Spiritual Growth (what I’ve come to label this as going from a church-goer to disciple). So with all this, I went into my prayers for the night.\\nReally, the crux of our exchange was about law and grace and the BOTH AND nature of these two attributes of our Abba Father found in the Word. Not either-or but both-and. We touched on the question of quantity – of how much- how much of the law was trumped once for all by Jesus? As the ultimate and final fulfilment of the law how much of what preceeded Jesus’ life on earth informs our lives and choices – our hearts and minds – on a practical, daily living, kingdom-of-heaven-is-NOW, basis. How are we transformed to the true self by anything other than grace?\\nInterestingly enough, the first reading from the Psalter this morning could not have been better for keeping me mindful of the overall question. Psalm 119 exposes the tension between LAW and GRACE – at least for me. Old School. New School. Old Testament. New Testament.\\nWhat I found myelf doing during the reading was subsituting – at times unconciously – ‘the law or statutes’ with the words LOVE and GRACE. For God is LOVE and by his grace we live. And here are a few of the verses that jumped out:\\nI’m not asserting that this is how this psalm or any of the Hebrew Scriptures should be read now that Jesus has come and died for all of us, once for all. No, rather it was just what the Spirit had me do as a way to further unpack the question my sister in Christ and I were trying to answer together.\\nBoth-And. His Word. His truth. His love and grace. Both schools – old and new. Both-and.\\nPraise Him.'),\n",

At the risk of oversimplifying, it doesn’t seem to have much of a point. We, the viewing audience, dive into Kevin Durant’s past to watch an apparent time traveler pretend to inform Durant of his eventual N.B.A. fate. In the lack of real purpose, we’re left to focus solely on the commercial’s aesthetic, which is as bizarre as it is false.\\nIt’s silly to ask how we -– along with our mystery traveler -– are transported to Rockville, Maryland circa 2005. After all, beyond a typical suspension of disbelief that accompanies the commercial medium, television ads are typically constructed in a serialized manner. In Television Culture, media scholar John Fiske described the serialized form as “an infinitely extended middle,” and in a sense, that’s where these spots take (and leave) us. The year 2005 isn’t a beginning in any sense for Durant, and we’re not privileged to see the process by which our traveler makes his way into Durant’s past. There’s also no real attempt at ending or closure, marking the images we see as some sort of enduring middleness, a journey which we join in progress. If nothing else, such a structure reinforces that this tale we’re witnessing is hardly our own.\\nMost television commercials include some element of voyeurism; we, the viewers, are thrust into the homes or heads of some subject and we haven’t the right. Yet these ads are stranger than most because we are voyeurs of the voyeur. The traveler isn’t present at all, but viewing the same vintage Durant footage that we are. He imposes his own dialogue as if he were present, even when the opposite is painfully true. The viewing audience was never intended to buy into the commercials as being completely authentic, but it’s beyond strange that this nameless man stands preaching to Durant, who laces up his shoes while looking straight through him.\\nUnnecessary though it may be to wonder how this stranger stumbled into a locker room (or at least some kind of pre-game prep room) six years in the past, it’s worth questioning why he went through so much trouble -– be it converting a DeLorean into a time machine, stumbling into a wormhole, or something – just to go back and tell Durant that he’ll be playing with some young players in Oklahoma City one day. The man clearly has something invested in the Thunder (“We’re gonna love you in OKC.”), and yet of all things to pass along to the Durant of the past, the traveler elects to throw out the name of Serge Ibaka for laughs?\\nWhy not tell Durant to urge Sam Presti to accept Tyson Chandler in a trade, regardless of what the team doctors say? Why not give Durant a little heads up that he might want to help box out Pau Gasol at the end of Game 6 in the 2010 playoffs? Or heck, when given the power of time travel, why not do something a little more self-serving or world-changing than strut into a room of high school basketball players with an I-know-the-future-and-you-don’t smirk?\\nAds don’t have to make complete logical sense, but ones that follow this type of structure should at least have a purpose. It doesn’t have to be complex, or even all that meaningful; the decidedly less creepy spot featuring Amar’e Stoudemire merely focuses on two New Yorkers as they admire Stoudemire’s work ethic. That may not sound like much, but it gives the commercial cause, rather than stumble on for 30 seconds as an unknown man chuckles to himself.\\nThe N.B.A. is blessed with a tremendously accessible game and oodles of unique stars, and that combination (along with some great ideas from the creative minds in the league’s marketing department) has generated many a memorable ad in the name of the league brand. This one misses the mark entirely, as Durant –- a humble, funny, charismatic star -– is reduced to a cardboard cutout. By having the normally magnetic Durant laugh on command and stare into space, we’re left with an odd vehicle for league promotion; the only items of interest are the strange intentions and unnerving mannerisms of a total stranger..'),\n",

Their message is simple: Early detection saves lives.\\nOne of the biggest challenges they face is changing the thinking of women who put everyone else in the family first.\\n\"When we meet with groups we teach them, if you want to take care of your family, you must take care of yourself first so you can be healthy and be there for them,\" Palencia said.\\nSince 2011, Yo Me Cuido has reached more than 2,000 women in 10 counties.\\nBut advocates know that much more needs to be done.\\nGroups like the American Cancer Society and Komen for the Cure have worked for years to increase breast cancer awareness. Especially in October, pink ribbons adorn everything from billboards and buses to NFL uniforms.\\nBut there are still women who seem unaware of what they can do to prevent cancer or detect it early. The problem is particularly deadly for minority women.\\nHispanic women historically have lower rates of breast cancer than do white, black and other minority women, according to the American Cancer Society. But breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic women, possibly because it is detected at a more advanced stage.\\nAnd while breast cancer rates among African-American women are lower than among white women, black women are 41 percent more likely to die of the disease. Lack of early detection may be contributing to this disparity, many experts think.\\n\"That\\'s why mammography screening is still so important for women in minority groups,\" said B. Lee Green, vice president for diversity at Moffitt Cancer Center and a senior member of the Health Outcomes and Behavior Program.\\n\"What\\'s happening with black women, in particular, is they are getting seen later, when the cancer is in a later stage, when the chances of survival tend to go down. That\\'s why it\\'s critically important to get them in for mammograms and to get them diagnosed early.\"\\nWomen of all backgrounds are generally much more aware of mammography than they are of genetic testing for cancer risk. But again, the disparity is even greater among minorities.\\n\"There\\'s lots of room for improvement there,\" said Susan Vadaparampil, a researcher, behavioral scientist and associate member in the Health Outcomes and Behavior Program at Moffitt.\\nBlack women are at increased risk for early-onset breast cancer — disease that strikes before age 50. \"That\\'s a big red flag that there might be something genetic going on and they may need to begin mammography screening earlier in life,\" said Vadaparampil. \"Yet African-American and Hispanic women are less likely to know genetic testing is available and they\\'re less likely to be referred for genetic testing by their health care providers.\"\\nMinority women are less likely than white women to participate in clinical trials, adding to the knowledge gap. Vadaparampil is involved in a statewide study recruiting black women 50 and younger who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2009 and 2012. As part of the study, they are offered genetic counseling and testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.\\n\"We want to learn about the impact of genetic counseling and testing in a group we traditionally don\\'t know a whole lot about,\" said Vadaparampil, adding that 400 women already are in the study and 200 more are needed.\\nCarol Tim of St. Petersburg is part of a group that\\'s working hard to improve African-American women\\'s access to breast cancer detection and treatment. Tim, 52, is a two-time breast cancer survivor with a sister who also had the disease. She is active in the faith-based, nonprofit group Sistahs Surviving Breast Cancer. Members support one another, hold educational events, and speak to minority women\\'s groups about the importance of mammograms, early detection, and genetic testing and counseling.\\n\"I knew testing was available to me because I have insurance through work,\" she said. \"But I know a lot of women who don\\'t have insurance and don\\'t know it\\'s something they can do.\"\\nTim was tested a few years ago at the suggestion of her Moffitt physician. \"Because with me having breast cancer, my sister having it and because I have a daughter, I just needed to be proactive and find out if there is a gene so (my daughter) doesn\\'t have to go through what we\\'ve gone through,\" she said.\\nOne way that all women can protect themselves and their families, Green said, is to talk about relatives who have had cancer at reunions and other get-togethers.\\n\"We have to have those conversations so we can share information with each other and with our (health care) providers,\\'\\' Green said. \"Then they can make the best recommendations about screening, prevention and genetic testing.\"\\nIrene Maher can be reached at imaher@tampabay.com.'),\n",

This appeared last year, I have since gutted the room and had the walls rendered and plastered. I also had a new window installed at the same time. I must admit that the old window was in awfull nick and after inspection I had come to the conclusion that this was the cause of the damp problem. It is now obvious that this was not the case (the builder didn't advise me otherwise however).\\nAnyway. Today (first dry day in South Wales for quite a while) I have scraped all loose paint off the window sill, which I have found to be in bad condition. The best way of describing this would be a loose top layer of stone, almost as though water has penetrated beneath the top layer and caused it to seperate (in wood I would describe this as delaminating, though I don't think this would be the correct terminology for stone?). I have also removed the loose pieces of stone. I'll upload photos shortly.\\nAlong with the above, beneath the paint I have unearthed a crack on either side of the sill, from front to back of the sill. Again I will upload photos shortly.\\nI am now under the impression that this (the cracks) is the source of the water ingress. Please could you offer your proffessional opinions on this problem. Any comments will be greatly appreciated.\\nIn the meantime (as soon as I have typed this) the only thing I can think of to remedy this temporarily is to get the silicone sealant out and go to town (I am desperate to save the nice new plastered wall inside).\\nRight! I'm off to play with the sill again.\\nCheers.\"),\n",

This can often diffuse the situation from the get-go.\\n“John, I reviewed the invoice thoroughly, and it’s correct. Let’s recheck the invoice together and I’ll explain the charges.”\\n“Perhaps you’re correct. That’s not the information I have.” “You may be correct. If so, I’ll the first person to say so.”\\n“Mr. Smith, we did tell you for that specific product, it may take about three days for us to ship.”\\n“Mr. Customer, we sent a letter after your purchase explaining what the warranty covers and what it does not cover. If you will review it, you will find that we were clear about this. Can we review it together?”\\n“As much as I want you to be a happy customer, and I’d like to about to tell you I can do this for you, I can’t.”\\n“If the salesman promised that to you, I’ll have to discuss it with him. We have never promised this in the past.”\\n“Mr. Jones. We’ve been doing business for twenty years. We have loyal customers and our business is growing. That’s because we believe in honesty and integrity. We would never ‘rip off’ any customer.”\\nWhen All Else Fails:\\nDecide if you should give in a little just to keep the customer. This holds true even when you know from the bottom of your toes that you are right, or when the customer is lying. When you do, your blood pressure may go up, but you have to keep the customer happy to the best of your ability.\\nSometimes, you have to decide if you want to stick to your guns and risk the possibility of losing the customer. Sometimes, you have to fire a customer because it’s just not worth the hassle. As I said, each situation is different. No one can afford to lose a customer, but you must decide how to proceed.\\nRemember Nordstrom’s Two Rules:\\n1. The customer is always right.\\n2. When the customer is wrong, refer to Rule # 1.\\nConsider This Quote from My Customer Service Training Program:\\n“The Customer is Always Right? Wrong! The Customer is Still the Customer.\\nThere is No Right or Wrong.”\\nKeep in mind that under all circumstances, you must come across professionally, and never brash or defensively. When you have to communicate with customers who are dead wrong – Remember to BREATHE!\\nNeed training on customer service?\\nOr, let’s brainstorm!

Carole Hough, professor of onomastics – the study of name origins – at Glasgow University, said the surnames of Orkney and Shetland differ from much of mainland Scotland due to naming traditions.\\n“Shetland and Orkney are unique in that they have a much higher proportion of surnames from local place names, which makes them quite distinctive. Place names tend to cluster around their origin, which is surprising given how mobile people are,” she added\\nThe English derived surname Smith is the most dominant across the whole of Great Britain with a considerable stronghold in the lowlands and east of Scotland. Modern-day immigration shows in areas such a Glasgow’s Pollokshield’s East, with Ahmed, Ali and Singh popular surnames. Jones, Davies and Williams dominate in Wales.\\nLooking to the future, a resurgence in the popularity of traditional Scottish forenames in recent years is likely to combat Anglicisation, said Hough.\\n“Far more Gaelic and Celtic-derived personal names are being chosen by parents in Scotland, which can be a way of affirming national identity,” she says. “Gaelic-derived forenames that are in the top 100 names in Scotland at the moment include Aiden, Callum and Finlay.

AI is increasingly being adopted by CRES as it can significantly improve efficiencies – creating better, more comfortable work environments, saving organizations money and relieving CRES Teams from dull repetitive tasks to focus on higher value work.\\nHowever, dissenters remain justifiably sceptical. Data collection (what and why) and privacy/ storage are all issues which data creators (employees) are concerned about.\\nStorage and data security is a complex issue with many influencing variables (country/ region of data capture, sector and internal data policies) to be considered that can only be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\\nBut, the reason for collecting data and what’s collected by CRES can be more universally addressed. Regardless of location and sector, AI is being adopted by CRES for the same fundamental reason – to create better and safer workplaces improving the user experience and delivering better CRES-side efficiencies.\\nThe key to broad, successful AI acceptance is demonstrating to the user that data collection comes with significant benefit for them. The trade-off of allowing CRES to understand where employees are in facilities, employees get improved facilities. Education and communication can be improved outlining these benefits. The other element positively swaying attitudes towards AI is the language being used.\\nBut, CRES is doing a poor job of communicating to building users and our customers how collecting data and using AI across day-to-day and longer term planning will improve their workplace experience.\\nEducating Employees on How CRES Uses AI and Why\\nAs Artificial Intelligence quickly becomes ubiquitous through all technologies (smart buildings and autonomous vehicles to name a few) implementation comes with varying success levels. Mainstream media tends to highlight the failures over the successes – stoking fears. Common concerns surrounding AI include the elimination of many jobs.\\nBut, we know that 20% of all building users feel that workplaces are not meeting their needs. This has a significant impact on how they feel when on-site and also on their productivity. Implementing AI-driven technology enables round-the-clock environmental monitoring allowing rapid resetting bringing the environment to the ideal temperature with the right light levels – a huge benefit to building users that is not being sufficiently communicated.\\nLooking to longer-term horizon and incorporating AI into strategic space planning, AI-equipped sensors monitor where employees go, collecting the data CRES relies on to identify usage trends throughout facilities. These people driven trends gives CRES a better understanding of what’s working in facilities. AI’s capabilities to collect and reliably analyze big data quickly enables this identification meaning CRES can continue replicating successes facility-wide while reducing the space types that employees clearly don’t like and don’t use.\\nIn this era of hyper-data collection on and offline with people are being manipulated or scammed or their details are being leaking, CRES needs to be clear with employees what data is being collected from them in order to make facilities safe and more comfortable for them. And, fortunately, the answer, not much data. CRES is only interested in binarys – if a person is in a space or not. Sensors don’t monitor what’s being done or productivity levels as monitoring these activities is not CRES’ purpose. Most sensors don’t identify a person, which means that, at the point of collection the data is anonymized. The sensor simply records that a space has a person in it. Even though data collection is anonymous, it’s still important to let employees know they are part of facilities management now with their movements throughout a day contributing to strategies improving building performance. Being able to communicate this by outlining what data is collected and next steps is an easy way to change minds especially where the results are immediately apparent to users (i.e. buildings do become more comfortable and safer).\\nThese employee-centric advantages have only been possible in the last few years thanks to AI driven technology. Communicating the experience improvement is part of the education required to win over reluctant and fearful employees. CRES is not using AI for nefarious reasons, instead to improve the user’s experience when on-site.\\nRe-orientating Language to Reflect Employee-centric Benefit\\nAs Raj Krishnamurthy – CEO of Workplace Fabric – has noted ‘Workplace Occupancy Sensors’ can do much more than simply monitor occupancy – both from a sensor capability, but also when linked to a deeper, smart system that’s driven by AI to adjust environmental conditions based on occupancy – and does not do justice to what the technology is actually capable of. By changing the language, renaming the sensors to be ‘workplace availability sensors’, the benefit is reframed focussing the primary benefit to the employee. Now employees can easily understand which workplaces are available for them to go and work in.\\nSummary\\nArtificial Intelligence is a technology many are fearful of. And media, by and large, are happy to perpetuate these fears through clickbait worthy headlines.\\nThis creates a challenge for CRES who are incorporating AI for its ability to support day-to-day building management and aggregate the data required to plan effective buildings for tomorrow. But, simply communicating what’s being done and why will help to tackle fears, especially where wins are quick to come to fruition and the benefit to employees is so apparent.'),\n",

The interchange will be on the north side of the A8, just on the Edinburgh side of gogar roundabout.\\nUnfortunately Network Rail is not taking cycling seriously. They are doing the easy bits, like connecting the new station to the north side of the A8 and providing bike parking. However, a new underpass of the A8, linking the Gyle to the new station will be designed for walkers only, although you will be allowed to push a bike.\\nEven if you are short of time, it is quick and easy to make a very short objection, and this really helps!\\nObjections must reach Edinburgh City Council by this Friday 13 November. To make a short submission, use the ‘submit comments’ button at the above link to the planning application. We suggest that you categorise your comment as an ‘objection’ – or you have the alternative of making a ‘general observation.’ Make sure to quote the number of the planning application, 09/02589.\\nPlease also copy your objection to your local councillors and ask them to support you at the Planning Committee. Find them at.\\nIf you are after 13 November it’s too late for a formal objection, but still very worthwhile asking your councillors to support you on this at the Planning Committee.\\nThe planning application itself admits that the current position for cyclists wishing to access the area of the site is appalling. It says [Transport Assessment, 3.7] “routes for crossing the A8 necessitate large diversions, via the RBS overbridge approximately 800m to the west of the roundabout, or via signal controlled pedestrian crossings at the Turnhouse Road/A902 Maybury Road/A8 Glasgow Road junction approximately 600m to the east.”\\nThe planning application’s reason for not allowing cycle use [Transport Assessment, 6.4] is so outdated in its understanding that it could be almost amusing if this wasn’t so serious, “The subway will be gated at its southern end to form an entrance to the interchange, which will be more attractive to users. As a result, pedestrian users of the subway may not expect cyclists on their cycles to be using the subway. Signage will be installed to instruct cyclists to dismount within the subway, and so maximise the quality of the subway experience for the majority of users.”\\nNetwork Rail should be following the Council’s Standards for Sustainable Buildings which state that development proposals should “offer genuine and practical alternatives to car use by prioritising €˜desire€™ lines for pedestrians and cyclists.” We can hardly call this a genuine and practical prioritising of cyclist desire lines!!\\nThere are some other important points to be made – please considering including these in your objection …\\na. The proposal is an underpass which is basically station-access only, and so will be closed off when the station is not open. The underpass should instead be part of Edinburgh’s path network, and open 24/7.\\nb. The path from the underpass should continue through the station site so as to link on to other expected future developments in the area, allowing continuous cycle access between them and the Gyle. At present only a 2m wide footpath is proposed beyond the station to a future ‘International Business Gateway’ development.\\nNote – If you decide to look at the plans online, click ‘associated documents’ at the link to the planning application. You’ll find masses of documents. Relevant ones include the TRANSPORT ASSESSMENT (it is in 2 files) and ‘PROPOSED SITE PLAN SHOWING INGRESS ROUTES.’\\nMisleading information – Network Rail in several places refers to the underpass as “pedestrian/cycle access” – but only by carefully reading the transport assessment do you discover that it is actually pedestrian access only, although you are permitted to push things such as bikes. Similarly, a Spokes member who commented at an earlier stage was told by Network Rail, “For foot and cycle passengers on the south side of the A8 further access to the east side of the station is provided via a subway below the A8. This subway will also enable rail passengers to access the Gyle Shopping Centre.” Very, very cheeky – implying, though not actually stating, that proper cycle access will be provided. They must not be allowed to get away with this!!\\nFinally, the project is being funded by the Scottish government via Transport Scotland. When we comment on the government’s low spending on cycling we are constantly told that as well as the well-known money to councils the government also spends on cycling via Transport Scotland’s big projects – if so, let’s see them take cycling seriously here! Indeed, there’s a good argument for also writing to your MSPs, asking them why Transport Scotland is being allowed to fund schemes which don’t take cycling seriously.\\n.'),\n",

Farah Naqvi writes.india Updated: Sep 19, 2011 21:51 IST.\\nIt’s inevitable that justice for the weak will be a political hard sell. And laws around the world seeking to secure justice and equality for the weak have been forged through fires of hot contestation. The first Civil Rights Act of 1957 in the US was greeted by howls of protest from White chauvinists.\\nEven ‘liberal’ John F Kennedy chose political realism over principle and voted against it in Congress for he knew it had little popular support at the time. JFK became a ‘civil rights champion’ later; some say only when he sensed greater need for the Black vote.\\nCloser home, the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, was preceded by a robust Dalit rights movement, and high profile cases of Dalit atrocities set the stage for its passage.\\nBut the backlash soon followed and attempts continue till today to stymie its implementation. The Draft Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence Bill, 2011, (PCTV) faces similar challenges.\\nThese laws are different from the spate of legislative and policy measures in recent years ensuring basic entitlements. Take the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Education (RTE) — one promised employment to the rural poor, the other elementary education.\\nThese are unexceptionable wares to peddle in the political marketplace of populist ideas, lending themselves easily to sound byte debates in TV studios, apparently the new testing ground for ‘popular will’.\\nThe arguments that NREGA and RTE faced weren’t social or political, but economic (with neo-liberals asking: ‘Will there be too much burden on the exchequer?’ Or ‘Why do the poor deserve such generous hand-outs?’).\\nBut special protection legislations, within a civil rights framework, seeking to install systems of justice for the weak are different. They demand that we as a nation acknowledge inequality and discrimination as a fact of our society, polity and criminal justice system. They demand the naming of particular classes of citizens as weak and others as strong.\\nThey demand from our political class a will to embrace principles of equal, secular citizenship over the politics of populism.\\nThe PCTV bill is anti-secular, it should be burnt, it should be put in a trashcan — these are are some of the unnecessarily strident remarks we’ve heard in recent TV debates.\\nCuriously, the government’s discredited Communal Violence Bill of 2005 didn’t elicit such shrill abandonment of civilised discourse because the 2005 bill didn’t challenge the biased use of State power that allows communal violence to spread.\\nIn fact, it augmented and further concentrated powers in the hands of the State (Modi would have embraced such a bill).\\nThe 2011 PCTV Bill, by comparison, attracts vicious protest partly because it does threaten the communal violence machinery, by making the State accountable for discriminatory use of its powers.\\nEvidence of this does not need to be excavated from the recesses of distant history — because State bias in cases of identity-based attacks is not a thing of the past, as critics claim. Look at the fate of Dalits and Muslims in recent weeks and months — in Madurai (September 2011), Moradabad (August 2011) or Bharatpur (September 2011); look at Tamils in Karnataka (March 2008) or Biharis in Mumbai (October 2008). They are why we need this bill.\\nThere may be much in the draft PCTV Bill, 2011 that its critics can improve, but its core (robust State accountability) represents the hope of securing equal protection of laws for all citizens; of giving meaning to the idea of sadbhavna.\\nPolitical momentum follows from acts of political courage and for true sadbhavna we need that courage from our political class.\\n(Farah Naqvi is a member of the National Advisory Council.

A common phrase surrounding local organizations\\' approach to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\\nThe effects of the coronavirus are already being seen in Ohio from the Ohio High School Athletic Association\\'s decision on Thursday to postpone the remainder of the winter tournaments to restrictions to visitors to nursing homes.\\nDuring a press conference Thursday afternoon, Gov. Mike DeWine made several major announcements including an order restricting mass gatherings of groups larger than 100, excluding restaurants, libraries, hospitals and grocery stores.\\nIn addition, he announced an \"extended spring break\" of three weeks for Ohio\\'s children beginning Monday.\\nEven before the announcement schools had been working on their plans for what do to if schools had to close.\\nLancaster City School District Superintendent Steve Wigton said all the actions the school has taken is precautionary and they will be following the state\\'s recommendations.\\nIn a letter sent to district parents, Wigton assured them the administration was observing the news and adjusting as necessary. In an effort to keep students up on the curriculum, plans involving take-home lessons were outlined.\\n\"The elementary school students would have their packets to fill out, and junior and high school students will be able to use their Chromebooks to complete their online assignments,\" Wigton said. \"For students that don\\'t have internet available at home, there are still hotspots available through our T-Mobile grant.\"\\nHe said all events for all grades, kindergarten through 12, involving parents and the public have been cancelled until after the district\\'s spring break. For any other additional changes, Wigton said they\\'d be announced by building administrators.\\n\"We don\\'t want to confuse an already confusing situation. We\\'re going to try to postpone what events we can and see what we need to implement to create social distance,\" he said. \"We\\'ve also reminded students of proper handwashing procedures, and the schools have plenty of disinfectant and soap.\"\\n\"These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary measures. But we have extraordinary people and we will get through this.\"\\nThe Fairfield County Jail has also started implementing safe practices to help limit contact with people showing syndromes of the novel coronavirus.\\n\"We\\'ve started to have our medical experts screening incoming inmates in the sally port. So far none of have shown any symptoms of the virus, but we are prepared to reject them,\" Alex Lape, Fairfield County Sheriff\\'s Office chief deputy, said. \"They\\'ll most likely be sent to Fairfield Medical Center for examination.\"\\nMore COVID-19 coverage\\n- Event cancellations due to the coronavirus\\n- NCAA men\\'s and women\\'s basketball tournaments will not include fans due to coronavirus concerns\\n- Fairfield County polling places won\\'t be moved due to coronavirus\\n- 3 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Cuyahoga County; DeWine declares state of emergency\\n- Ohio asks universities to go to remote learning; wants limits on sports due to coronavirus\\nFor now, the sheriff\\'s office is working to limit contact within the jail and the civil branch. Lape said none of the inmates or staff have displayed any symptoms, but it\\'s best to be cautious for now. Visits were non-contact to begin with, and can be conducted online.\\nLape added the sheriff\\'s office is working closely with the health department and the Fairfield County Emergency Management Agency to keep ahead of the situation.\\n\"We have plans in place in case we have to enact them. Right now, we\\'re focused on maintaining the health of those incarcerated and our staff,\" he said.\\nFather Craig Eilerman, of St. Mary\\'s of the Assumption in Lancaster, said events involving people outside the parish have been cancelled.\\n\"We will continue to have masses, unless we are told otherwise or if the pandemic spreads here. However, we are cancelling some of our other events, just to help minimize the risk of spreading any illness,\" he said. \"And during our masses, we will only be distributing the consecrated bread, there will be no wine.\"\\n\"These actions are preventative in nature, the idea is to cut down on large gatherings as much as we can. We are a people of hope, we will get through this.\"\\nRev. Brian Jones, the senior pastor of the Lancaster First United Methodist Church, issued the following statement.\\n\"We are taking the outbreak of the Coronavirus seriously. We are taking extra measures to disinfect the \"touchpoints\\' of the church (door handles pews door knobs etc.) throughout the week to insure we keep the church as clean and virus free as possible. Your health, and the health of your family are a priority for us in our overall ministry. We are not planning to cancel worship. As far as other events we will treat them on a week to week basis as we hope the crisis will pass in due time and our ministry schedules can return to normal.\"\\nThe Pickerington Food Bank announced it would also be changing its delivery options for the time being.\\nIn a statement, the food pantry said it will be distributing pre-packaged boxes on Thursdays and Saturdays only from 10 to 11:30 a.m., beginning March 19. It will no longer be open on Mondays.\\nWhen customers arrive at the pantry, they should proceed down the alley, as they did for holiday basket distributions.

I had created arranged in order to meet my lady in a nearby recreation space in order that my own 3 boys could blow-off a number of water prior to planning property for supper.\\nIt had been there in a vehicle recreation area that we noticed a person trying to clay-bar their own automobile. Certain things struck us as unusual. To start with while i have already been based in Exercise the past 20 years We have seldom witnessed someone work with their own automobile along with the following was a man wanting to clay bar! That was fantastic.\\nSecondly this individual ended up being trying really without success for you to clay bar his / her auto. I couldn’t support myself personally, I needed to bring in personally and offer him several ideas.\\nPupil this individual ended up being a us surviving in Europe anf the husband has been organizing the rear spoiler in order that he or she might aluminum foil that. He’d learnt from the Internet in which before using foil that the paint surface has to be decontaminated with a clay-bar. Appropriate! Nevertheless exactly what the forum failed to tell him ended up being just what is a Clay-Bar and ways to use it correctly?\\nSo what is a new Clay Bar?\\nInside the Eighties, a few extremely intelligent people in The japanese invented the particular Clay-Bar. Car makers had been trying to find a approach to speedily remove overspray coming from recently coloured autos and never have to vacation resort moist sanding. Nowadays it is unimaginable to get a expert detailer to never make use of a clay-bar.\\nDecontaminating the color.\\nWhenever a vehicle can be powered or even sitting outside the house, it will pick-up a few quite unpleasant grime debris like very hot braking system airborne debris, iron debris coming from train songs, street tar residue even unclean rain could imprinted themselves in to the coloring. Inside the describing globe we all call this ‘contamination’ and eliminate substances is certainly a important action i will attempt to describe without sending that you rest.\\nSoil contaminants upload themselves deeply in to the obvious coating. Washing the car won’t remove these types of partials. It is essential to take away the toxins before sharpening as if you not can become with additional hairline chafes.\\nI want to make clear. Make a very small small materials regarding fine sand trapped to the surface of the paint. If you don’t take away that wheat involving mud and you review that using a sprucing device that is rotating in 1’500 revs per minuet. In which resolution is certain to get captured inside the mat and also provide simple facts in wonderful round moves. The same as sand paper. That hurts!\\nJust how Clay Bar aids\\nClay bar can be a desperate stop regarding pliable plastic just like content which has a similar uniformity to learn money. Consider it as any ‘dirt magnet’. Since the clay is indeed ‘sticky’, the dirt does not have any chance of clinging on the fresh paint surface area; the idea re-embeds alone on top of the clay bar. Following numerous goes by, the particular clay bar will become packed with substances, which you can observe within the image and for that reason you have to on a regular basis collapsed the particular clay to press the determination to the core of the clay.\\nWhat’s crucial when using clay as well as what my good friend in a vehicle car park was without is ‘Lubrication’. Lubes might be clean water or even even better any detailers bottle of spray that you simply spray directly on top of the autos area. Unless you work with a squirt the actual clay will undoubtedly stick to the area, end up being difficult to shift making a terrible mess with pieces of clay adhering your car or truck rather than raising from the dirt. Even worse it could possibly also scratch your car or truck.\\nDone correctly, it is possible to notice the paint turning into cleaner. That will start as being a itches sound then after a few goes gets silent as well as less noisy. I’m talking about the actual clay undertaking it can be operate raising off of all of the nasty’s.\\nOnce you’ve done your coloring has become de-contaminated.\\nAlso an important tip! Should you unintentionally decline your own clay, throw it away. There isn’t any chance of keeping becoming soon as it has contacted the floor; it’s picked out more dirt this ever could from the vehicle. In the event you begin to use that once more, it’s going to scratch the coloring.'),\n",

Parents question how much “rope” to give a child, worrying that there might be too much, and the child will “hang himself.” Other parent’s worry that being too strict will result in their teen rebelling, losing respect, and not loving them. Others consider rebellion and defiance to be “normal” in teenagers and thus may rarely take a teen’s misbehavior seriously. While to some degree rebellion and defiance are natural, it has been found that excessive rebellion and excessive defiance are usually indicators of an oppositional defiant behavior disorder and are not necessarily associated with health.\\nThe problem is that most parents only have the model of discipline that was meted out to them as children and teens. For many, identification with the normal rebellious and defiant aspects of the teenage years has never been normalized by mature growth; thus they either subtly (or not so subtly) stimulate “bad behavior,” only to follow it, in their own anxiety and confusion, by administering punishment to the adolescent. Not surprisingly, this causes the teen perplexity, anxiety, and confusion.\\nOn the other hand, constructive discipline tends to result in the development of a mature young adult by the end of the adolescent passage. It helps a teenager control his impulses, cooperate with other people, and be patient. The aim of discipline should not be to develop a homogenized and completely socialized teenager; parents should always stress the uniqueness of their teenage sons and daughters. Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life. Disciplining a teenager is different from disciplining a younger child since the teenager is more mature, more reflective, and more able to enter into discussions and negotiations. This means that discipline can and should always be enlightening to teenagers, never a means of deriding, shaming, or making them feel as if they are “bad.”\\nWhat to Do\\n- Don’t be a cruel parent. Don’t humiliate, criticize destructively, physically attack, or try to cripple your teenagers will just in order to make him conform to certain rules.\\n- Make expectations and rules clear to your child.\\n- Don’t be scared to set limits.\\n- Do not make rules arbitrarily, even if you feel strong about them; they should involve some give and take.\\n- Understand that whatever teaching and disciplining you do, most teenagers will mature through trial and error.\\n- Reward constructive behavior rather than criticize bad behavior.\\n- Be a role model for your teenager.\\n- Be compassionate and patient when it comes to discussion of family rules and responsibilities.\\n- When punishing your teenager it is best to withdraw privileges. However, make sure to not over-punish because you are angry.\\n- Never use physical or mental torture.\\n- Don’t give in to tantrums or loud and intimidating behavior, and don’t allow guilt to cloud your judgment.\\n- Remember, teenagers test the limits. You will be tested!\\nIn the end, be compassionate and empathetic and remember what it was like to be a teenager. Your greatest influence on your child doesn’t come through your punishment but through your being a good role model and your ability to understand the situation and act appropriately..'),\n",

All I have to do is chop some raw ingredients and it makes me look like a great cook. I’m not, but it allows me the indulgent self-delusion and that’s not to be sniffed at.\\nThere are some surreal side effects though –\\n1. Following breakfast, you do all the preparation for your tea. This can leave you wondering when exactly in the day it is.\\n2. By the time its ready to eat you’ve kinda forgotten you had anything to do with it, because you go into the kitchen “to make tea” and all you have to do is dish it up. This makes you feel like someone else made it (always a good thing). It can also make you feel like you get your food from meals on wheels (not always a good thing).\\nMy simple and incredibly lazy recipe for slow cooking happiness –\\n1. Chop up a few potatoes, as many as you’d have if you were having baked potatoes. Don’t worry about peeling them, its going to be cooking for ages and you’ll not even notice them. Chuck them in the slow cooker.\\n2. Very lazy bit – add some frozen vegetables, whatever you fancy. Just throw them in the pot frozen, they’ll be fine. The slow cooker will be going long enough to cook them properly.\\n3. Chop an onion, don’t throw that in yet.\\n4. Chop up some meat to your preference. Steak and kidney is good. So is turkey. I’m partial to lambs hearts myself.\\n5. Grab a pan, put some Extra Virgin Olive Oil in and put it on the heat. Make sure its extra virgin oil, not because it’ll make any difference to the end product, but because it’ll make you feel more like a proper cook. If you really want to add to the ambience, make sure its in a poncy bottle too.\\n6. Throw the meat into the hot oil, knock it about a bit until it starts to brown, then throw the chopped onion in too. Make sure you turn on the extractor fan when you’re doing this, so that people passing can think you’re a proper cook because of the nice smells coming out of your kitchen. (Note, this will only work if your neighbours and anyone passing can’t cook. Anyone who can cook will know that the only reason you’ll be cooking anything savoury that early in the morning is because you’re slow cooking and therefore can’t cook at all).\\n7. Once the meat has browned, put the meat and onions into the slow cooker. Add in about 350ml of water, a stock cube and salt and pepper, give it a stir and set it going.\\n8. If you happen to be around a couple of hours before it finishes cooking, throw in a handful of paxo for some extra flavour and some thickening.\\nErm, that’s it. Not exactly rocket science eh?'),\n",

My friend and I had raised questions with each other about the motivation behind prayer and what prayer looks like. We talked about the in-dwelling of the Holy Spirit. Transformation vs. performance and where the former comes from, and how. Rohr’s contributions to the discussion concerned the 9 stages of Spiritual Growth (what I’ve come to label this as going from a church-goer to disciple). So with all this, I went into my prayers for the night.\\nReally, the crux of our exchange was about law and grace and the BOTH AND nature of these two attributes of our Abba Father found in the Word. Not either-or but both-and. We touched on the question of quantity – of how much- how much of the law was trumped once for all by Jesus? As the ultimate and final fulfilment of the law how much of what preceeded Jesus’ life on earth informs our lives and choices – our hearts and minds – on a practical, daily living, kingdom-of-heaven-is-NOW, basis. How are we transformed to the true self by anything other than grace?\\nInterestingly enough, the first reading from the Psalter this morning could not have been better for keeping me mindful of the overall question. Psalm 119 exposes the tension between LAW and GRACE – at least for me. Old School. New School. Old Testament. New Testament.\\nWhat I found myelf doing during the reading was subsituting – at times unconciously – ‘the law or statutes’ with the words LOVE and GRACE. For God is LOVE and by his grace we live. And here are a few of the verses that jumped out:\\nI’m not asserting that this is how this psalm or any of the Hebrew Scriptures should be read now that Jesus has come and died for all of us, once for all. No, rather it was just what the Spirit had me do as a way to further unpack the question my sister in Christ and I were trying to answer together.\\nBoth-And. His Word. His truth. His love and grace.

At the risk of oversimplifying, it doesn’t seem to have much of a point. We, the viewing audience, dive into Kevin Durant’s past to watch an apparent time traveler pretend to inform Durant of his eventual N.B.A. fate. In the lack of real purpose, we’re left to focus solely on the commercial’s aesthetic, which is as bizarre as it is false.\\nIt’s silly to ask how we -– along with our mystery traveler -– are transported to Rockville, Maryland circa 2005. After all, beyond a typical suspension of disbelief that accompanies the commercial medium, television ads are typically constructed in a serialized manner. In Television Culture, media scholar John Fiske described the serialized form as “an infinitely extended middle,” and in a sense, that’s where these spots take (and leave) us. The year 2005 isn’t a beginning in any sense for Durant, and we’re not privileged to see the process by which our traveler makes his way into Durant’s past. There’s also no real attempt at ending or closure, marking the images we see as some sort of enduring middleness, a journey which we join in progress. If nothing else, such a structure reinforces that this tale we’re witnessing is hardly our own.\\nMost television commercials include some element of voyeurism; we, the viewers, are thrust into the homes or heads of some subject and we haven’t the right. Yet these ads are stranger than most because we are voyeurs of the voyeur. The traveler isn’t present at all, but viewing the same vintage Durant footage that we are. He imposes his own dialogue as if he were present, even when the opposite is painfully true. The viewing audience was never intended to buy into the commercials as being completely authentic, but it’s beyond strange that this nameless man stands preaching to Durant, who laces up his shoes while looking straight through him.\\nUnnecessary though it may be to wonder how this stranger stumbled into a locker room (or at least some kind of pre-game prep room) six years in the past, it’s worth questioning why he went through so much trouble -– be it converting a DeLorean into a time machine, stumbling into a wormhole, or something – just to go back and tell Durant that he’ll be playing with some young players in Oklahoma City one day. The man clearly has something invested in the Thunder (“We’re gonna love you in OKC.”), and yet of all things to pass along to the Durant of the past, the traveler elects to throw out the name of Serge Ibaka for laughs?\\nWhy not tell Durant to urge Sam Presti to accept Tyson Chandler in a trade, regardless of what the team doctors say? Why not give Durant a little heads up that he might want to help box out Pau Gasol at the end of Game 6 in the 2010 playoffs? Or heck, when given the power of time travel, why not do something a little more self-serving or world-changing than strut into a room of high school basketball players with an I-know-the-future-and-you-don’t smirk?\\nAds don’t have to make complete logical sense, but ones that follow this type of structure should at least have a purpose. It doesn’t have to be complex, or even all that meaningful; the decidedly less creepy spot featuring Amar’e Stoudemire merely focuses on two New Yorkers as they admire Stoudemire’s work ethic. That may not sound like much, but it gives the commercial cause, rather than stumble on for 30 seconds as an unknown man chuckles to himself.\\nThe N.B.A. is blessed with a tremendously accessible game and oodles of unique stars, and that combination (along with some great ideas from the creative minds in the league’s marketing department) has generated many a memorable ad in the name of the league brand. This one misses the mark entirely, as Durant –- a humble, funny, charismatic star -– is reduced to a cardboard cutout. By having the normally magnetic Durant laugh on command and stare into space, we’re left with an odd vehicle for league promotion; the only items of interest are the strange intentions and unnerving mannerisms of a total stranger..'),\n",

But her sister-in-law, Patricia Tobon, reacted quite differently.\\nTobon found a lump and ignored it. \"She didn\\'t tell anybody,\" remembers Escobar, who had been friends with her since childhood. \"She didn\\'t pay any attention to it for a long time. She thought it was nothing.\"\\nTobon died at age 50, leaving behind two teenage sons.\\n\"That is what motivates me to do my job,\" said Escobar, a community outreach worker at Moffitt Cancer Center. \"I don\\'t want other women to lose the battle against breast cancer just because they don\\'t know what to do about it.\"\\nEscobar is part of a team at Moffitt that conducts breast cancer education programs for Hispanic women. The program, Yo Me Cuido (\"I Take Care of Myself\\'\\'), recently won praise from the White House, where Escobar was invited to accept an award.\\nAlong with senior community outreach worker Jeannette Palencia, Escobar makes presentations in Spanish in homes, workplaces, churches, beauty salons, libraries, wherever they are invited. Their message is simple: Early detection saves lives.\\nOne of the biggest challenges they face is changing the thinking of women who put everyone else in the family first.\\n\"When we meet with groups we teach them, if you want to take care of your family, you must take care of yourself first so you can be healthy and be there for them,\" Palencia said.\\nSince 2011, Yo Me Cuido has reached more than 2,000 women in 10 counties.\\nBut advocates know that much more needs to be done.\\nGroups like the American Cancer Society and Komen for the Cure have worked for years to increase breast cancer awareness. Especially in October, pink ribbons adorn everything from billboards and buses to NFL uniforms.\\nBut there are still women who seem unaware of what they can do to prevent cancer or detect it early. The problem is particularly deadly for minority women.\\nHispanic women historically have lower rates of breast cancer than do white, black and other minority women, according to the American Cancer Society. But breast cancer is still the leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic women, possibly because it is detected at a more advanced stage.\\nAnd while breast cancer rates among African-American women are lower than among white women, black women are 41 percent more likely to die of the disease. Lack of early detection may be contributing to this disparity, many experts think.\\n\"That\\'s why mammography screening is still so important for women in minority groups,\" said B. Lee Green, vice president for diversity at Moffitt Cancer Center and a senior member of the Health Outcomes and Behavior Program.\\n\"What\\'s happening with black women, in particular, is they are getting seen later, when the cancer is in a later stage, when the chances of survival tend to go down. That\\'s why it\\'s critically important to get them in for mammograms and to get them diagnosed early.\"\\nWomen of all backgrounds are generally much more aware of mammography than they are of genetic testing for cancer risk. But again, the disparity is even greater among minorities.\\n\"There\\'s lots of room for improvement there,\" said Susan Vadaparampil, a researcher, behavioral scientist and associate member in the Health Outcomes and Behavior Program at Moffitt.\\nBlack women are at increased risk for early-onset breast cancer — disease that strikes before age 50. \"That\\'s a big red flag that there might be something genetic going on and they may need to begin mammography screening earlier in life,\" said Vadaparampil. \"Yet African-American and Hispanic women are less likely to know genetic testing is available and they\\'re less likely to be referred for genetic testing by their health care providers.\"\\nMinority women are less likely than white women to participate in clinical trials, adding to the knowledge gap. Vadaparampil is involved in a statewide study recruiting black women 50 and younger who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2009 and 2012. As part of the study, they are offered genetic counseling and testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations.\\n\"We want to learn about the impact of genetic counseling and testing in a group we traditionally don\\'t know a whole lot about,\" said Vadaparampil, adding that 400 women already are in the study and 200 more are needed.\\nCarol Tim of St. Petersburg is part of a group that\\'s working hard to improve African-American women\\'s access to breast cancer detection and treatment. Tim, 52, is a two-time breast cancer survivor with a sister who also had the disease. She is active in the faith-based, nonprofit group Sistahs Surviving Breast Cancer. Members support one another, hold educational events, and speak to minority women\\'s groups about the importance of mammograms, early detection, and genetic testing and counseling.\\n\"I knew testing was available to me because I have insurance through work,\" she said. \"But I know a lot of women who don\\'t have insurance and don\\'t know it\\'s something they can do.\"\\nTim was tested a few years ago at the suggestion of her Moffitt physician. \"Because with me having breast cancer, my sister having it and because I have a daughter, I just needed to be proactive and find out if there is a gene so (my daughter) doesn\\'t have to go through what we\\'ve gone through,\" she said.\\nOne way that all women can protect themselves and their families, Green said, is to talk about relatives who have had cancer at reunions and other get-togethers.\\n\"We have to have those conversations so we can share information with each other and with our (health care) providers,\\'\\' Green said. \"Then they can make the best recommendations about screening, prevention and genetic testing.\"\\nIrene Maher can be reached at imaher@tampabay.com.'),\n",

This appeared last year, I have since gutted the room and had the walls rendered and plastered. I also had a new window installed at the same time. I must admit that the old window was in awfull nick and after inspection I had come to the conclusion that this was the cause of the damp problem. It is now obvious that this was not the case (the builder didn't advise me otherwise however).\\nAnyway. Today (first dry day in South Wales for quite a while) I have scraped all loose paint off the window sill, which I have found to be in bad condition. The best way of describing this would be a loose top layer of stone, almost as though water has penetrated beneath the top layer and caused it to seperate (in wood I would describe this as delaminating, though I don't think this would be the correct terminology for stone?). I have also removed the loose pieces of stone. I'll upload photos shortly.\\nAlong with the above, beneath the paint I have unearthed a crack on either side of the sill, from front to back of the sill. Again I will upload photos shortly.\\nI am now under the impression that this (the cracks) is the source of the water ingress. Please could you offer your proffessional opinions on this problem. Any comments will be greatly appreciated.\\nIn the meantime (as soon as I have typed this) the only thing I can think of to remedy this temporarily is to get the silicone sealant out and go to town (I am desperate to save the nice new plastered wall inside).\\nRight! I'm off to play with the sill again.\\nCheers.\"),\n",

This can often diffuse the situation from the get-go.\\n“John, I reviewed the invoice thoroughly, and it’s correct. Let’s recheck the invoice together and I’ll explain the charges.”\\n“Perhaps you’re correct. That’s not the information I have.” “You may be correct. If so, I’ll the first person to say so.”\\n“Mr. Smith, we did tell you for that specific product, it may take about three days for us to ship.”\\n“Mr. Customer, we sent a letter after your purchase explaining what the warranty covers and what it does not cover. If you will review it, you will find that we were clear about this. Can we review it together?”\\n“As much as I want you to be a happy customer, and I’d like to about to tell you I can do this for you, I can’t.”\\n“If the salesman promised that to you, I’ll have to discuss it with him. We have never promised this in the past.”\\n“Mr. Jones. We’ve been doing business for twenty years. We have loyal customers and our business is growing. That’s because we believe in honesty and integrity. We would never ‘rip off’ any customer.”\\nWhen All Else Fails:\\nDecide if you should give in a little just to keep the customer. This holds true even when you know from the bottom of your toes that you are right, or when the customer is lying. When you do, your blood pressure may go up, but you have to keep the customer happy to the best of your ability.\\nSometimes, you have to decide if you want to stick to your guns and risk the possibility of losing the customer. Sometimes, you have to fire a customer because it’s just not worth the hassle. As I said, each situation is different. No one can afford to lose a customer, but you must decide how to proceed.\\nRemember Nordstrom’s Two Rules:\\n1. The customer is always right.\\n2. When the customer is wrong, refer to Rule # 1.\\nConsider This Quote from My Customer Service Training Program:\\n“The Customer is Always Right? Wrong! The Customer is Still the Customer.\\nThere is No Right or Wrong.”\\nKeep in mind that under all circumstances, you must come across professionally, and never brash or defensively. When you have to communicate with customers who are dead wrong – Remember to BREATHE!\\nNeed training on customer service?\\nOr, let’s brainstorm!

Mackenzie, Fraser and Ross are the most popular in the area North of Inverness, while MacLeod and MacDonald dominate the Western Isles – data that directly corresponds with clan territory maps.\\nIn the Northern Isles Halcrow, Drever and Flett survive as the third most common surnames, while Shetland still boasts a diverse mix of Spences, Rendalls and Sinclairs. Carole Hough, professor of onomastics – the study of name origins – at Glasgow University, said the surnames of Orkney and Shetland differ from much of mainland Scotland due to naming traditions.\\n“Shetland and Orkney are unique in that they have a much higher proportion of surnames from local place names, which makes them quite distinctive. Place names tend to cluster around their origin, which is surprising given how mobile people are,” she added\\nThe English derived surname Smith is the most dominant across the whole of Great Britain with a considerable stronghold in the lowlands and east of Scotland. Modern-day immigration shows in areas such a Glasgow’s Pollokshield’s East, with Ahmed, Ali and Singh popular surnames. Jones, Davies and Williams dominate in Wales.\\nLooking to the future, a resurgence in the popularity of traditional Scottish forenames in recent years is likely to combat Anglicisation, said Hough.\\n“Far more Gaelic and Celtic-derived personal names are being chosen by parents in Scotland, which can be a way of affirming national identity,” she says. “Gaelic-derived forenames that are in the top 100 names in Scotland at the moment include Aiden, Callum and Finlay.

AI is increasingly being adopted by CRES as it can significantly improve efficiencies – creating better, more comfortable work environments, saving organizations money and relieving CRES Teams from dull repetitive tasks to focus on higher value work.\\nHowever, dissenters remain justifiably sceptical. Data collection (what and why) and privacy/ storage are all issues which data creators (employees) are concerned about.\\nStorage and data security is a complex issue with many influencing variables (country/ region of data capture, sector and internal data policies) to be considered that can only be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\\nBut, the reason for collecting data and what’s collected by CRES can be more universally addressed. Regardless of location and sector, AI is being adopted by CRES for the same fundamental reason – to create better and safer workplaces improving the user experience and delivering better CRES-side efficiencies.\\nThe key to broad, successful AI acceptance is demonstrating to the user that data collection comes with significant benefit for them. The trade-off of allowing CRES to understand where employees are in facilities, employees get improved facilities. Education and communication can be improved outlining these benefits. The other element positively swaying attitudes towards AI is the language being used.\\nBut, CRES is doing a poor job of communicating to building users and our customers how collecting data and using AI across day-to-day and longer term planning will improve their workplace experience.\\nEducating Employees on How CRES Uses AI and Why\\nAs Artificial Intelligence quickly becomes ubiquitous through all technologies (smart buildings and autonomous vehicles to name a few) implementation comes with varying success levels. Mainstream media tends to highlight the failures over the successes – stoking fears. Common concerns surrounding AI include the elimination of many jobs.\\nBut, we know that 20% of all building users feel that workplaces are not meeting their needs. This has a significant impact on how they feel when on-site and also on their productivity. Implementing AI-driven technology enables round-the-clock environmental monitoring allowing rapid resetting bringing the environment to the ideal temperature with the right light levels – a huge benefit to building users that is not being sufficiently communicated.\\nLooking to longer-term horizon and incorporating AI into strategic space planning, AI-equipped sensors monitor where employees go, collecting the data CRES relies on to identify usage trends throughout facilities. These people driven trends gives CRES a better understanding of what’s working in facilities. AI’s capabilities to collect and reliably analyze big data quickly enables this identification meaning CRES can continue replicating successes facility-wide while reducing the space types that employees clearly don’t like and don’t use.\\nIn this era of hyper-data collection on and offline with people are being manipulated or scammed or their details are being leaking, CRES needs to be clear with employees what data is being collected from them in order to make facilities safe and more comfortable for them. And, fortunately, the answer, not much data. CRES is only interested in binarys – if a person is in a space or not. Sensors don’t monitor what’s being done or productivity levels as monitoring these activities is not CRES’ purpose. Most sensors don’t identify a person, which means that, at the point of collection the data is anonymized. The sensor simply records that a space has a person in it. Even though data collection is anonymous, it’s still important to let employees know they are part of facilities management now with their movements throughout a day contributing to strategies improving building performance. Being able to communicate this by outlining what data is collected and next steps is an easy way to change minds especially where the results are immediately apparent to users (i.e. buildings do become more comfortable and safer).\\nThese employee-centric advantages have only been possible in the last few years thanks to AI driven technology. Communicating the experience improvement is part of the education required to win over reluctant and fearful employees. CRES is not using AI for nefarious reasons, instead to improve the user’s experience when on-site.\\nRe-orientating Language to Reflect Employee-centric Benefit\\nAs Raj Krishnamurthy – CEO of Workplace Fabric – has noted ‘Workplace Occupancy Sensors’ can do much more than simply monitor occupancy – both from a sensor capability, but also when linked to a deeper, smart system that’s driven by AI to adjust environmental conditions based on occupancy – and does not do justice to what the technology is actually capable of. By changing the language, renaming the sensors to be ‘workplace availability sensors’, the benefit is reframed focussing the primary benefit to the employee. Now employees can easily understand which workplaces are available for them to go and work in.\\nSummary\\nArtificial Intelligence is a technology many are fearful of. And media, by and large, are happy to perpetuate these fears through clickbait worthy headlines.\\nThis creates a challenge for CRES who are incorporating AI for its ability to support day-to-day building management and aggregate the data required to plan effective buildings for tomorrow. But, simply communicating what’s being done and why will help to tackle fears, especially where wins are quick to come to fruition and the benefit to employees is so apparent.'),\n",

Photo: Supplied\\nA quarry-turned-illegal swimming hole in Brisbane\\'s south could be exposing swimmers to potentially dangerous mineral levels and acidic water.\\nThe old Boral quarry, located on private property on Pine Mountain Road at Mt Gravatt East, is frequently being used by trespassers as a playground to swim, cliff dive and even parasail.\\nBrisbane Deputy Mayor Adrian Schrinner said people needed to realise it was unsafe to trespass or swim in the disused quarry.\\n\"Boral was required to carry out water testing a number of years ago and the water was found to be unsuitable for human contact,\" he said.\\n\"It is my understanding that the water has been affected by minerals leaching out of the rocks and that the water may cause skin irritation for some individuals. If the water is accidentally ingested, it may also make people sick.\"\\nA Brisbane City Council report showed the water had a pH level of about 3.3, which was highly acidic, and also contained traces of metals \"in excess of acceptable levels\" and low nutrient levels.\\nCr Schrinner said he believed the majority of trespassers knew they were not permitted to enter the quarry.\\n\"Kids will be kids, however, the key issue here is one of safety,\" he said.\\n\"The trespassers should take a few moments to ask themselves if they want to risk spending the rest of their life in a wheelchair.\\n\"They need to accept some personal responsibility for their own actions. If they knowingly trespass and put themselves in danger, it would be wrong to blame Boral if they are injured.\"\\nCr Schrinner, who is also the local councillor for the area, said several residents had raised their concerns with him about people accessing the site.\\n\"I have kept the quarry owners, Boral, and the local police informed about these complaints,\" he said.\\nBulimba Creek Catchment Co-ordinating Committee member Wayne Cameron said Boral had to regularly replace the fences, locks and chains on the gates because they were often being cut with bolt cutters.\\n\"Boral has over 60 warning signs at the site saying \\'untreated water and trespassing on private property\\' as well as perimeter fencing,\" he said.\\n\"There is consistent break ins into the quarry according to Boral and we have seen people come past our property as well, so people are definitely going into the property on a regular basis.\"\\nA Boral spokeswoman said the company was \"extremely concerned\" about trespassers on its land and urged the public to \"stop this illegal and unsafe activity\".\\n\"The water quality is not managed to ensure suitability for swimming,\" she said in a statement.\\nThe Boral spokeswoman said it was important for parents, in particular, to be aware that if their children are illegally accessing the site that they may be at risk.\\n\"Riding bikes on the site and swimming in the quarry lake are particularly dangerous activities,\" she said.\\nMr Cameron said Boral had security guards patrolling the area once a month to check the perimeter fencing and fix any damage that had been done to it.\\n\"They have security guards patrolling the area every two weeks on school holidays and every month during normal periods to stop illegal access points,\" he said.\\n\"Boral cant do much more than they have already done, they have followed legal and security requirements, but if people want to break in they will break in regardless.\"\\nMr Cameron said one of the causes of the problem could be that there was not enough recreational activities available to young people in Brisbane\\'s outer suburbs.\\n\"There is a lack of social structure in some suburbs in Brisbane, and not a lot for young people to do so that\\'s why the quarry is so attractive to them,\" he said.\\nThe Boral spokeswoman said the company had asked for the community\\'s co-operation to \"to report any suspicious activities around the Pine Mountain Road.')]"

Rather, discipline should result in a teen taking a wholehearted and responsible approach to life.
